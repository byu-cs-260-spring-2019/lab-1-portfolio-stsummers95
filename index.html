    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img id="pic1" src="resources/about_me_pic.jpg">
    <p>My name is Stephen Summers. I am a senior at Brigham Young University studying Computer Engineering. It seems that many entry level programming or coding jobs like to see at least some web programming experience, so I decided to take CS 260, hence the existence of this page. I am 23 years old and the oldest of five children. I grew up in San Jose, California, and I lived in western Idaho for two years as a church missionary. I am excited to see how this web programming class can help me in my search for an entry level job!</p>

    <p>My work experience involves a number of different team experiences. I feel that I have been prepared to work with a variety of teams, and I believe this will help me to contribute well in the work force. In order of relevance to jobs dealing with computers, I would rate the importance of my work experience as follows:</p>
